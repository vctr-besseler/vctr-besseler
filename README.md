# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## I'm Victor, a 27 years old technology enthusiast and psychology student from Brazil!

### About Me
I have been working with runescape private server development for the past 3 years and have become proficient in Java doing so. I also use Python on a regular basis to automate parts of my job. I can work with both relational and non-relational databases, and altho it's not my strongest skill, I can also do some basic web development. I use GitHub as my main version control tool but most of my repositories are private. I have used both Windows and Linux as my main operating system and have recently started learning how they work more in-depth. I am currently trying to improve my web development skills by learning Node.js and am also doing some research on socket programming with the C programming language on my free time. Ah, and I'm also working on getting my bachelors degree in Psychology!
